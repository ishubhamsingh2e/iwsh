The project aims to develop and discover different ways possible to interact with software and hardware.
the project contains a python package to interact with multiple hardware and software, for example:

- controlling different OS-level components
  - Cursor
  - keyboard
  - volume
- controlling different types of hardware components like
  - servo's
  - relays
  - moter

the project also tries to interact with VR to interact with different type of components.
Most of the features are in development, so be patient and hope for the best result possible.
